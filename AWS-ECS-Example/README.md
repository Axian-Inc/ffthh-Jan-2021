A series of examples based on https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/quickref-ecs.html.

Note that only one instance of [0-ecs-demo.yaml](./ecs-demp.yaml) template (copied from the above URL) may be stood up and any given time in a single AWS account. [1-ecs-demo.yaml](./1-ecs-demo.yaml) fixes that.

See the comments at the top of each file to see what was changed.
